Fork of [bongo.cat](http://bongo.cat) with MIDI features! You might recognize the song that plays when the page loads ;) (Due to browser restrictions, you might have to click the page or press a button first to hear sound)

Features / differences from the original:
- Web MIDI to support plugging in a MIDI keyboard/device
- Uses [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/) instead of [lowLag.js](https://lowlag.alienbill.com/) and [SoundManager2(https://www.schillmania.com/projects/soundmanager2/)
